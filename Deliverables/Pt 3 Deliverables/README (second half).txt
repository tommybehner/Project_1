In the root of the deliverables folder you will find a Doxygen folder,
which contains all the auto generated html documentation. The Doxygen folder
has a shortcut to bring you directly to the list of our classes.
Also in the root of the deliverables is the Source Code file, which contains
all of our template classes and headers. We also have the Class Diagram,
The Use Case Diagram, and the extended Use Cases.
